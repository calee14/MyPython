# MyPython
Various python programs that I'm currently developing: webscraping, python programming styles, back-end code, apis, constructing databases, advanced python concepts, and misc.

# Getting Started
To install the code to your local machine, run the git command in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/calee14/MyPython.git
```
Make sure to install all dependencies before running any scripts. Once installed you can use python to run any of the files with this command:
```
python name_of_file.py
```
# Deployment
Make sure you have the python command or a python shell installed to run the scripts

# Built With
A lot of stuff

# Authors
**Cap Lee** - probably going to be the only author.
