# Intro to blockchain
## Blockchain definitions
- some dude took the blockchain system/program that ran bitcoin and made etheruem with it which uses smart contracts.
- smart contracts are agreements that don't require a third party to be written
    - smart contracts are written in code that will be executed
    - smart contracts need real world data
        - __blockchain oracles__ help bring in real world data into to the blockchain or run external computation 
        - __hybrid smart contracts__ blockchain is decentralized and off-chain data such as computations and real world data need to be decentralized.
        - chainlink = decentralized oracle network that bring real world data and computations off-chain
        - Dapp = smart contract = decentralized app 
            - smart contract platforms = blockchains
            - hybrid smart contract = smart contract with some off-chain component like real world data and computation

## Blockchain properties
- decentralized = no single entity controls the whole network
    - data on the blockchain is immutable, meaning it can't be changed
    - similarly hacking the blockchain is nearly impossible, thus assets and data are protected on the blockchain
- based on math-based agreements aka trust-mimized agreements
    - agreements based on agreements not human interaction or people
    - opposite of political trust-based agreements
- decentralization gives freedom
- DAOs = decentralized autonomous organizations
    - applications or orgs the live on the blockchian

## MetaMask and Eth Wallets
- make accounts and wallets to the eth blockchain on MetaMask
- etherscan.io for viewing the eth blockchain
