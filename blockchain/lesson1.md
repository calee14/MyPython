# Solidity
- when deploying from remix eth I'm using meta mask as my web3 which is called injected web3. metamask is acting as my node on the blockchain network
- when we deploy we're making a transaction to make a contract on the blockchain
- EVM = ethereum virtual machine
- smart contract code is compiled to the EVM so that the code can be run on the blockchain
